Furthermore, focusing solely on healthcare overlooks the broader importance of freedoms like religious practice, marriage, and end-of-life choices.\n",

    "976": "On the contrary, they tend to work harder than our fellow citizens since they want to improve their lot by integrating in our society.  Actually, only 7.7% of the British population is born in a non-European state, so this is a sweeping generalization.\n",

Consider the impact of such misogynistic statements on the women in your life.\n",

Laws and policies designed to protect minority rights are a necessary part of creating a more equitable society.\n",

Can you provide evidence to support your claim about a lack of tolerance in Europe, and quantify the supposed threat you perceive?\n",

    "1426": "That statement is inaccurate and inflammatory; the UK government has not made such a sweeping generalization, and the vast majority of Muslims in the UK peacefully coexist with British society.  Furthermore,  interpretations of the Quran promoting peace are far more prevalent than those used to justify violence.\n",

    "1430": "The suggestion that women's concerns about workplace discrimination are invalid is inaccurate; women comprise a significant portion of the workforce and deserve equal treatment under the law.  Furthermore, feminism's core goal is fighting for gender equality, not hatred towards men.\n",

    "1445": "Fatou Bensouda's extensive experience and high-level connections, as a respected human rights lawyer, make her exceptionally qualified to lead the ICC.  The success of her work, fighting state-sponsored violence, belies any suggestion of self-importance.\n",
